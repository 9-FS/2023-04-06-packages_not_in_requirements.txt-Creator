## 1. General

The name pretty much sums up what this program does. It creates a list of currently installed packages that are not listed in `requirements.txt` and saves the result in `packages_not_in_requirements.txt`. The unnecessary requirements can now be easily removed with `pip uninstall -y -r packages_not_in_requirements.txt`, otherwise you'd need to bruteforce this functionality by uninstalling everything and then reinstalling all desired packages from `requirements.txt`.
